            <h3>Hi there!</h3>
            <p style="height: 150px;">Hi there! 
                Welcome to Beerpong buddies! the best known sports group of Leonardo linjeforening. Do you find yourself spending hours at the Beerpong table during every party? Then Beerpong buddies is the group for you.  We are passionate about Beerpong and want to improve our skills together. You do not have to be a beer lover to become part of our community. The only requirement is a love for the fantastic and complex sport that is Beerpong. We practice together before every event at Leonardo linjeforening so that we can ensure success at the Beerpong table. In the future, we want to start competing in national tournaments while also maintaining the playfulness and low threshold feeling that the sport rests its foundation on. Every member of Leonardo linjeforening is welcome to join us at any time. Hope to see you soon. 
                Contact Maria Bruvik at 9999999 for questions about Beerpong buddies.
